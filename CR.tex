Question 2 : Do you think that the key size of sip\_hash\_2\_4 is large enough to make an exhaustive search of the keyspace intractable? Can this function be considered to be collision-resistant?

Here, we have a $2^{128}$ key space. According to the first lesson of the class, if we want to be sure to have a result whitin 34 years ($2^{30}$ seconds), we'd need hardware with $2^{50}$ iterations per second, this should be trivially parallelizable, and each device should use 1000W without overhead.

Which, still according to the lesson, mean that we need $2^{128-50-30}$, so $2^{48}$ machines, which is approximately 280 000 000 GW, about the output of 170 000 000 EPR nuclear power plants.

For a fusion reactor outputting 1500 MWatt per second, this would require about 5 years of production. We just need to figure out fusion first.

Antimatter might be a solution, provided we can find better technology, and not have to spend about 63 trillions for a gram of antimatter. Then the energy would need to be harvested in some way too.

But for the collision, we have a problem. The Birthday paradox mean that we have a complexity of $2^{n/2}$, so here, we have 4294967296 possibilities, which is not that big.

Question 4 : 

At first we tried a naive implementation : compute the hash every time, and compare them using a loop. Needless to say, as we are writing the report the loop is still running. This is not an efficient way to do.

We also tried pre-computing a hash table for a given key. The computing wasn't over and the table was over 20GB in size, and this was for ONE key.

We then decided to try a smarter way of finding a collision, using the britday paradox. The probability that one message has the same digest as another is of $\frac{1}{1/(2^{32} - 1}$. But as we add more message, we can start improving our chances of finding a collision. This mean that we will not have to compute every possible hash for a decent chance of finding a collision. If we compute $2^32-1$ messages, our chances are of $100\%$, according to the pingeon-hole principle (if you have $n$ cages, and $n+1$ pigeon, if you put a pigeon in every empty cage then you will need to have a cage with two pigeons in it).

The probability of someone sharing a birthday with someone else in a room of $n$ people is of $1 - (\frac {364}{365})^{\binom {n}{2}}$. Since we have $2^{32}-1$ possibilities here, the corresponding formula for our hash would be  $1 - (\frac {2^{32}-2}{2^{32}-1})^{\binom {n}{2}}$. For $2^{18}$ hash, the probability of having a collision is of $0.99966\%$ and with $2^{19}$, we have probability of $1$. This mean that we only need to compute $2^19$ hash to find a collision, which is much better than have to compute $2^{32}$ hashes.

Outputting that smaller raibow table result in a file that's about 11MB large, which can be held in memory. Computing such a table is very fast, and we are able to find a collision in less than a second. Interestingly, the collision is always found at the same place for different keys:
